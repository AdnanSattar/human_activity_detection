# Inference Configuration for Human Activity Detection

# Model settings
model:
  checkpoint_path: "outputs/models/Human_Activity_model.pt" # Path to trained model
  conf_threshold: 0.65 # Confidence threshold for detections (balanced - higher reduces false positives but may miss rare classes)
  iou_threshold: 0.6 # IoU threshold for NMS (increased to 0.6 to better remove overlapping false positives)

# Input settings
input:
  source: "data/test/images" # Can be: image path, video path, directory, webcam (0), or RTSP stream
  imgsz: 640 # Inference image size
  agnostic_nms: false # Class-agnostic NMS
  max_det: 10 # Maximum number of detections per image (reduced from 300 to limit false positives)

# Output settings
output:
  save_dir: "outputs/inference"
  save_txt: true # Save results as .txt files
  save_conf: true # Save confidence scores
  save_crop: false # Save cropped detection images
  show_labels: true
  show_conf: true
  line_width: 2 # Bounding box line width

# Video settings (if input is video)
video:
  save: true
  format: "mp4" # Options: mp4, avi, mkv
  fps: 30 # Output FPS (will use source FPS if available)

# Display settings
display:
  show: true # Show results in window
  wait_key: 1 # Wait key delay (ms), 0 = wait for key press

# Device settings
device:
  gpu_id: 0 # GPU device ID, use "cpu" for CPU inference
