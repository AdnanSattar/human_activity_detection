# Training hyperparameters
training:
  epochs: 200 # Minimum viable epochs for decent results (200+ recommended for production)
  batch_size: 8 # Adjust based on GPU memory (MX450 has 2GB, so 8 is reasonable)
  imgsz: 640
  device: "0" # GPU device ID, use "cpu" for CPU training
  workers: 1 # Set to 0-1 on Windows to avoid multiprocessing memory issues (1 worker worked fine)
  cache: false # MUST be false to avoid paging file errors (not enough RAM available)
  lr0: 0.001 # Initial learning rate (reduced from default 0.01 to prevent NaN losses)
  lrf: 0.01 # Final learning rate factor

# Augmentation settings
augmentation:
  enabled: true
  mixup: 0.1

# Optimization settings
optimization:
  amp: false # Automatic Mixed Precision (FP16) - DISABLED to prevent NaN losses
  multi_scale: true # Multi-scale training
